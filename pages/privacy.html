                Better Housing B.V. & affiliated companies
              </p>
              <p>
                At Better Housing, we value your privacy and the trust you place
                in us. Whether you are a client, potential client, or simply in
                contact with our company, you may share personal information
                with us. This can happen when you call, email, send documents,
                visit our office, or speak with one of our representatives.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because we often handle personal data as part of our services,
                we want to assure you that we process this information
                carefully, transparently, and in full compliance with privacy
                laws. This Privacy Statement explains what personal data we
                collect, why we collect it, and how we protect it.

                1. What is personal data?
              </p>
              <p>
                Personal data refers to any information that can identify an
                individual, either directly or indirectly. This includes obvious
                details such as your name, address, or email, but can also
                include combinations of data like a postal code with a house
                number.
              </p>
              <p>
                Information about deceased persons or legal entities (such as
                companies) is not considered personal data. Some information —
                like racial or ethnic background, religious beliefs, or health
                data — is categorized as special personal data and is subject to
                additional protection measures.
              </p>

              <p class="pb-2">
                When you interact with Better Housing, certain personal
                information may be collected. We only use this data for clear
                and legitimate purposes, such as:

              <p>

                We never sell or share your personal data with third parties
                without your explicit permission or a valid legal reason. When
                we do work with trusted partners, we ensure that they apply the
                same level of data protection and confidentiality that we
                maintain internally.
              </p>
              <p>
                The processing of personal data is always based on one or more
                of the following grounds:
              </p>
              <p>
                A. To perform a contract or take steps at your request before

                We process personal data from clients, business partners,
                website visitors, and anyone who communicates with us.

                purposes.
              </p>
              <p>
                We apply robust technical and organizational security measures
                to protect your data from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse.
                Our staff are trained and aware of their responsibilities in

                access your personal data. Every Better Housing employee is
                bound by a confidentiality agreement, ensuring that your
                information remains private. Only authorized staff are permitted
                to handle personal data, and they do so strictly within the
